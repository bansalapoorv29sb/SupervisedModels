Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method widely used in data science to explore relationships between variables. 
In this, we will study through a hands-on project applying linear regression to a real-world dataset. 
Our aim is to simplify the process and demonstrate how this technique can extract valuable insights from data in practical scenarios.
